Chrome extension for link search navigation like Firefox has

## How to install it
Eventually, I will upload this extension to the Chrome web store, but for now it must be installed manually.
For now, download this repository and follow the instructions that can be found at [https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) under "Load the Extension".

To summarize the process: 
1. Open Chrome://extensions in Chrome
2. Check "Developer mode" at the top
3. Click "Load unpacked extension"
4. Find this extension's "extension" folder in your filesystem and select it.


## How to use it
For those who are familiar with the link search keyboard shortcut on Firefox, it works the same way, but F2 is used to cycle through the links instead of F3.

For those who are unfamiliar:
* Press ' to start searching.
* Type some text in the search bar to highlight a link.
* Press Esc to stop or Enter/Ctrl-Enter to follow it.
* Press F2 to continue where you left off.

## The technologies used
It's a Chrome extension written in JavaScript.
